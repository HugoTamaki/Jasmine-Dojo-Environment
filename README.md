== Jasmine Dojo Environment

This is a simple dojo environment to use with <b>Jasmine</b> and <b>Node.js</b>

To use this, clone this repo and run <b>npm install jasmine-node -g</b> to install Jasmine-node globally.

After that, you can run <b>jasmine-node . --color --autotest</b< and it will run your tests automatically and watch any change on files at <b>/app</b> and <b>/spec</b> folder.

Have fun :)
