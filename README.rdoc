== Jasmine Dojo Environment

This is a simple dojo environment to use with *Jasmine* and *Node.js*

To use this, clone this repo and call *npm* *install* at the root directory.
This will create a */node-modules* folder with the necessary libraries (jasmine-node).

After that, you can run *jasmine-node* *.* *--color* *--autotest* and it will run your tests automatically and watch any change on files at */app* folder.

Have fun :)
